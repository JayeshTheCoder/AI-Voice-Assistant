## Features
- **Real-time Audio Processing**: Streams live audio to and from the assistant.
- **Natural Language Processing**: Supports a range of commands and conversational capabilities.
- **Audio Synthesis**: Responds with synthesized speech.
- **LiveKit Integration**: Uses LiveKit for real-time audio streaming and communication.
